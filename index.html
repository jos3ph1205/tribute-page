            <h1>Chadwick Boseman</h1>
            <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman, an American actor, had a successful career spanning
               two decades. He gained recognition for his performances as various real-life
               figures and received multiple accolades, including Screen Actors Guild Awards,
               a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Boseman started his career
               in theatre after studying directing at Howard University and later transitioned
               to the screen. His breakthrough role came as baseball player Jackie Robinson in
               the film "42" (2013). He continued to portray historical figures, such as singer
               James Brown in "Get on Up" (2014) and Thurgood Marshall in "Marshall" (2017). </p>

                  <h3>1995</h3>
                  <p>Boseman graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995, where he wrote his first play, Crossroads,
                     and competed in Speech and Debate. He attended Howard University, graduating with a Bachelor of
                     Fine Arts in directing in 2000. Boseman drew inspiration from his experience working in an African
                     American bookstore.</p>

                  <h3>1998</h3>
                  <p>Boseman attended the Oxford Summer Program of the British American Drama Academy at Balliol
                     College, Oxford, England, with the help of Al Freeman Jr. and Phylicia Rashad, who became a mentor.
                     Boseman's passion for writing and directing led him to study acting and develop an appreciation for
                     William Shakespeare's playwriting and the works of various dramatists. He also traveled to Africa,
                     working with professor Mike Malone to preserve and celebrate rituals on a proscenium stage. After
                     returning to the U.S., he graduated from New York City's Digital Film Academy.

                  <h3>2000</h3>
                  <p>Boseman lived in Brooklyn, New York City, at the start of his career. In 2000, he was named a Drama
                     League Directing Fellow. He directed productions including George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum
                     (Wolfe would later direct Boseman in his final role) and a staging of Amiri Baraka's Dutchman. He
                     worked as the drama instructor in the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, housed at the Schomburg
                     Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem between 2002 and 2009.

                  <h3>2001</h3>
                  <p>In 2002, he gained fame as a playwright and stage actor, winning an AUDELCO award for his role in
                     Ron Milner's Urban Transitions. He also played Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Malcolm in Macbeth.
                     Boseman directed and wrote plays in the Hip-hop theater movement, including Rhyme Deferred and
                     Hieroglyphic Graffiti. Both were commissioned for national tours and showcased at various venues.

                  <h3>2003</h3>
                  <p>Boseman began his television career in 2003 with Third Watch and later played Reggie Montgomery in
                     All My Children. He faced criticism for racist stereotypes in the script, but was re-cast with
                     Michael B. Jordan. Boseman aimed to work around these stereotypes, allowing for more improvisation
                     in soap operas. He also appeared in Law & Order, Cold Case, CSI: NY, and ER.

                  <h3>2004</h3>
                  <p>Boseman's best play Deep Azure, commissioned in 2004, was a fusion of his previous works about
                     police brutality. It was workshopped at the Apollo Theater in New York and praised by critic Chris
                     Jones. Boseman turned the play into a screenplay, which was directed by Michael Greene and produced
                     by him. Blood Over a Broken Pawn was also a notable film.

                  <h3>2008</h3>
                  <p>In 2008, Boseman relocated to Los Angeles to pursue his film and acting career. He appeared in
                     Lincoln Heights, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, and Persons Unknown, receiving mediocre
                     reviews. In 2013, he directed his second short film, Heaven, at the HollyShorts Film Festival.

                  <h3>2013</h3>
                  <p>In 2013, Boseman made his breakthrough role in the film 42, portraying baseball legend Jackie
                     Robinson. Boseman had been directing an off-Broadway play in the East Village when he auditioned
                     for the role. Director Brian Helgeland chose Boseman due to his bravery in reading the difficult
                     scene. Boseman trained with professional baseball coaches to replicate Robinson's mannerisms, and
                     spoke with Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, to discover the character. He also starred in the
                     independent film The Kill Hole.

                  <h3>2013</h3>
                  <p>In 2014, Boseman starred in Draft Day as fictional football player Vontae Mack. He had worked on
                     the Tupac Shakur jukebox musical Holler If Ya Hear Me in 2013, but chose to take on the role of
                     James Brown in Get on Up. Boseman worked with choreographer Aakomon Jones and producer Mick Jagger
                     to prepare for the role. Despite not wanting to return to the biopic for another 15-20 years,
                     Boseman was chosen by director Tate Taylor. Co-star Dan Aykroyd praised Boseman's performance,
                     stating it was neither replication nor impression. Boseman stayed in character between filming on
                     set, demonstrating a natural acting approach.

                  <h3>2014</h3>
                  <p>Boseman sold a thriller screenplay to Universal Pictures in 2014, which he collaborated on with
                     Logan Coles. He starred in Gods of Egypt in 2016, playing the role of Thoth, an Egyptian deity.
                     Despite criticism for using a predominantly white cast, Boseman accepted the role to ensure African
                     characters were played by someone of African descent. His first largely CGI film, Gods of Egypt,
                     was heavily criticized for lacking story and interesting characters.

                  <p>In 2015, Boseman started dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward. The couple allegedly became engaged
                     by October 2019 and eventually wed secretly, according to information provided by Boseman's family
                     in a statement announcing his passing.

                  <p>Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which progressed to stage IV before
                     2020. Despite his illness, he never publicly disclosed it, and only a few non-family members knew
                     about it. Despite multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, Boseman continued to work and completed
                     productions for several films.

                  <h3>2016</h3>
                  <p>Boseman began portraying Marvel Comics character T'Challa / Black Panther in Captain America: Civil
                     War. Boseman learned Xhosa from John Kani and developed a Wakandan accent himself. He felt pressure
                     not to "screw up" the beloved comics character, but identified more with the character's nemesis,
                     Killmonger, knowing that his roots to his African past had been severed. Producer Kevin Feige
                     explained that the character was included in Civil War because they needed a third party with a
                     different point of view than Tony or Steve. Boseman's performance in Civil War was highly praised,
                     but critics acknowledged the character's inclusion was largely to set up his upcoming headlining
                     movie.

                  <h3>2017</h3>
                  <p>In 2017, Boseman portrayed Thurgood Marshall in the biographical film Marshall, set years before he
                     became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. Boseman researched Marshall extensively
                     and studied videos to reflect his wiry frame. Despite initial concerns about being put into a
                     "biopic box," he enjoyed the script's historical relevance and the character's mentorship. The film
                     received average critical reception, but Vulture criticized Boseman's casting, stating that
                     Marshall's light-skinned appearance influenced his legend. Boseman was convinced that the film's
                     insular story did not matter as much.

                  <p>Boseman reprised his role in Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, both of which achieved
                     high grossings. Infinity War was filmed concurrently with Black Panther, with Boseman and other
                     actors improvising chanting scenes from the latter. His last physical appearance as Black Panther
                     was in Endgame, where he voiced alternate versions of T'Challa in the 2021 Disney+ animated series
                     What If...?.

                  <p>In 2019, Boseman was cast in Netflix films Da 5 Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, directed by
                     Spike Lee and George C. Wolfe respectively. Boseman expressed his desire to make non-superhero
                     films and co-produce a film about Yasuke, the first black man in Japan. He was included in Time's
                     list of the 10 Best Movie Performances of 2020 and received posthumous nominations for Ma Rainey,
                     becoming the eighth person to receive a posthumous Academy Award acting nomination.

                  <h3>2019</h3>
                  <p>In 2019, Boseman starred in 21 Bridges, an action thriller film directed by Brian Kirk. Boseman was
                     approached to work on the film by Avengers producers, the Russo brothers, and Endgame. Boseman was
                     also a producer on 21 Bridges, encouraging changes to the story and characters. He sought out
                     Sienna Miller as a co-star, who requested a salary that the studio could not meet, and donated the
                     rest from his own pay. Boseman also personally called Stephan James to play one of the criminals
                     Boseman's detective is hunting. Boseman and Coles fought for casting and actors with particular
                     sensibilities and feelings. In 2019, Boseman accepted the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding
                     Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

                  <p>Boseman died at his Los Angeles home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on August
                     28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side. He was 43 years old. He died intestate (without a
                     will), and his estate was governed by California law with the representation of Ledward. A public
                     memorial service was held on September 4, 2020, in Anderson, South Carolina. Speakers included
                     Boseman's childhood pastor as well as Deanna Brown-Thomas, daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman
                     portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced plans for the creation of a permanent art memorial at
                     the service. Despite reports that Boseman was buried at Welfare Baptist Church cemetery in nearby
                     Belton, South Carolina, the funeral home handling the services and the church pastor both denied
                     this.

         <p class="response-info">The day after Boseman died, the tweet in which his family announced his death on his
            Twitter account became the
            most-liked tweet in history, with over six million likes in under 24 hours, and accumulating over seven
            million by August 31, far displacing the previous record holder. His death was likened to other unexpected
            deaths
            of other celebrities in 2020, particularly Kobe Bryant and Naya Rivera. The Associated Press and Clarín
            noted
            Rivera and Boseman as Hollywood's most impactful 2020 deaths.</p>
