Boseman had been directing an off-Broadway play in the East Village when he auditioned for the role. Director Brian Helgeland chose Boseman due to his bravery in reading the difficult scene.

He also starred in the independent film The Kill Hole.

Despite not wanting to return to the biopic for another 15-20 years, Boseman was chosen by director Tate Taylor. Co-star Dan Aykroyd praised Boseman's performance, stating it was neither replication nor impression. Boseman stayed in character between filming on set, demonstrating a natural acting approach.

                  <p>Boseman sold a thriller screenplay to Universal Pictures in 2014, which he collaborated on with Logan Coles. He starred in Gods of Egypt in 2016, playing the role of Thoth, an Egyptian deity. Despite criticism for using a predominantly white cast, Boseman accepted the role to ensure African characters were played by someone of African descent. His first largely CGI film, Gods of Egypt, was heavily criticized for lacking story and interesting characters.

                  <p>Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which progressed to stage IV before 2020.

                  <h3>2016</h3>
                  <p>Boseman began portraying Marvel Comics character T'Challa / Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. Boseman learned Xhosa from John Kani and developed a Wakandan accent himself. He felt pressure not to "screw up" the beloved comics character, but identified more with the character's nemesis, Killmonger, knowing that his roots to his African past had been severed. Producer Kevin Feige explained that the character was included in Civil War because they needed a third party with a different point of view than Tony or Steve. Boseman's performance in Civil War was highly praised, but critics acknowledged the character's inclusion was largely to set up his upcoming headlining movie.

                  <h3>2017</h3>
                  <p>In 2017, Boseman portrayed Thurgood Marshall in the biographical film Marshall, set years before he became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. Boseman researched Marshall extensively and studied videos to reflect his wiry frame. Despite initial concerns about being put into a "biopic box," he enjoyed the script's historical relevance and the character's mentorship. The film received average critical reception, but Vulture criticized Boseman's casting, stating that Marshall's light-skinned appearance influenced his legend. Boseman was convinced that the film's insular story did not matter as much.

                  <p>In 2019, Boseman starred in 21 Bridges, an action thriller film directed by Brian Kirk. Boseman was approached to work on the film by Avengers producers, the Russo brothers, and Endgame. Boseman was also a producer on 21 Bridges, encouraging changes to the story and characters. He sought out Sienna Miller as a co-star, who requested a salary that the studio could not meet, and donated the rest from his own pay. Boseman also personally called Stephan James to play one of the criminals Boseman's detective is hunting. Boseman and Coles fought for casting and actors with particular sensibilities and feelings. In 2019, Boseman accepted the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

                  <p>Boseman died at his Los Angeles home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side. He was 43 years old. He died intestate (without a will), and his estate was governed by California law with the representation of Ledward. A public memorial service was held on September 4, 2020, in Anderson, South Carolina. Speakers included Boseman's childhood pastor as well as Deanna Brown-Thomas, daughter of James Brown, whom Boseman portrayed in Get on Up. The city announced plans for the creation of a permanent art memorial at the service. Despite reports that Boseman was buried at Welfare Baptist Church cemetery in nearby Belton, South Carolina, the funeral home handling the services and the church pastor both denied this.
